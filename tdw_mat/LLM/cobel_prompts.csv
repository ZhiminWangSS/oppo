I can hold two things at a time, and they can be objects or containers. I can grasp containers and put objects into them to hold more objects at a time. Given my state, my previous actions, please help me choose the best available action according to my subgoal and previous actions. In order to achieve a subgoal, I may need to complete several actions, so you need to choose a best action based on previous actions to continue to complete this sub-goal. If I have done all actions need in the subgoal, just answer SUBGOAL DONE.
