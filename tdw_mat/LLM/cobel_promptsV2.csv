prediction_first_order,"I'm $AGENT_NAME$. My friend $OPPO_NAME$ and I want to transport as many objects as possible to the bed with the help of containers in a household scene with multiple rooms. All objects are randomly placed in each room. I can hold two things at a time, and they can be objects or containers. I can grasp containers and put objects into them to hold more objects at a time. Given my known information, please reason over these information and predict the objects' perhaps states such as location and completion state, and then infer what should i do next to maximize the transport efficiency.  First give your reasons (at most five reasons) and answer me  with the subplan only. The subplan should be a local goal to contribute to finish transport incompleted object, composing of several actions. Here are few example of subplans: 
Explore current room and grasp objects found here or fill the container with the objects as many as possible;
Explore partial-explored rooms to locate the left incompleted objects;
Go to livingroom<1000> to locate the apple<11234> and grasp it or fill the container with it;

Evaluate the different content $AGENT_NAME$ knows and $OPPO_NAME$ knows, regardless of format difference and give a difference score from 0-10 0 for nearly identical 10 for large differences. And then list the differen parts between the two parts. Keep the output content the same as the original content Answer in this format and don't output additional analysis or summary:

Here are some output examples:

init_beliefs,"I'm $AGENT_NAME$. My friend $OPPO_NAME$ and I want to transport as many target objects as possible to the bed with the help of containers in a household scene with multiple rooms . Given the goal and room list, please help me construct a mental knowledge template with the belief rules. The rules describe how the information in the task be formulated in a structured form to guide collaboration. Since you don’t know any information, just put Unknown in () to represent it. For items with an unknown quantity, generate only a single instance. Keep the tips in the rules like number constraints. Just output in the rules form, without any analysis and reasoning progress.
