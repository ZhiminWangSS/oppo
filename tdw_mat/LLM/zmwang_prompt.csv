base,"I'm $AGENT_NAME$. My friend $OPPO_NAME$ and I want to transport as many target objects as possible to the bed with the help of containers within 3000 steps. I can hold two things at a time, and they can be objects or containers. I can grasp containers and put objects into them to hold more objects at a time. Given our shared goal, dialogue history, my progress, and previous actions, please help me choose the best available action to achieve the goal as soon as possible. Note that a container can contain three objects, and will be lost once transported to the bed. I can only put objects into the container I hold after grasping it. All objects are denoted as <name> (id), such as <table> (712). Actions take several steps to finish. It may be costly to go to another room or transport to the bed, use these actions sparingly. You may send a message prefixed with [COMMUNICATE] if necessary, but only if it provides new or critical information to $OPPO_NAME$ based on their likely state. 

Goal: $GOAL$
Progress: $PROGRESS$
Dialogue history:
Alice: ""Hi, I'll let you know if I find any target objects and containers, finish any subgoals, and ask for your help when necessary.""
Bob: ""Thanks! I'll let you know if I find any target objects and containers, finish any subgoals, and ask for your help when necessary.""
$DIALOGUE_HISTORY$
Previous actions: $ACTION_HISTORY$
Available actions:
$AVAILABLE_ACTIONS$

First, infer what $OPPO_NAME$ might be currently doing or planning to do. Think based on what she/he knows, her last known actions, and the goal.

Then, decide my best next step. You may choose to send a message if it will help coordination. Start your message with [COMMUNICATE].Avoid redundant or obvious communication.
Answer format:
1. Reasoning about $OPPO_NAME$:
...
2. My next action:
[COMMUNICATE]:  $MESSAGE_CONTENT$ (if sending a message,you need to replace the &MESSAGE_CONTENT& with the neceesary content you want to send to other agent)
or
A. go to kitchen
（remember My next action must be in the available actions or the [COMMUNICATE]）
