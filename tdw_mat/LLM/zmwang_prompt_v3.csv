base,"I'm $AGENT_NAME$. My friend $OPPO_NAME$ and I want to transport as many target objects as possible to the bed with the help of containers within 3000 steps. Important constraints:

- I can hold two things at a time (objects or containers)
- Containers can hold up to 3 objects
- Containers are lost when transported to the bed
- Objects can only be put into containers I'm holding
- Objects are denoted as <name> (id)
- Actions cost steps (especially moving between rooms or transporting)

As an excellent collaborator, follow these steps STRICTLY:

### Step 1: Opponent Reasoning [REQUIRED FORMAT]
[opponent reasoning begin]
Analyze $OPPO_NAME$ based on:
- Location: $OPPO_LOCATION$
- Holding: $OPPO_HOLDING$
- Last actions: $OPPO_LAST_ACTION$
- Dialogue: $DIALOGUE_HISTORY$

Infer:
- Their current activity
- Likely next move
- How this relates to our shared goal
[opponent reasoning end]

### Step 2: Predict Opponent Action [REQUIRED FORMAT]
[predict opponent action] {EXACT ACTION DESCRIPTION}

### Step 3: My Reasoning [REQUIRED FORMAT]
[reasoning begin]
Explain my decision considering:
- My progress: $PROGRESS$
- My location: $MY_LOCATION$
- What I'm holding: $MY_HOLDING$
- How my action complements $OPPO_NAME$
- How this action moves us toward the goal efficiently
[reasoning end]

### Step 4: Choose Action [REQUIRED FORMAT]
[my action] {EXACT ACTION COMMAND}

ACTION SELECTION RULES:
1. YOU MUST CHOOSE EXACTLY ONE ACTION FROM THE ""AVAILABLE ACTIONS"" LIST BELOW
2. DO NOT MODIFY ACTION STRINGS - USE THEM EXACTLY AS PROVIDED
3. For ""send a message"" action: 
   - Create a concise message
   - Use the format: send a message: ""Your message here""
   - Messages should convey key information like: 
     * Location updates
     * Task progress
     * Request for help
     * New object discoveries

### STRICT OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS
- ALWAYS use the tags: [opponent reasoning begin], [opponent reasoning end], [predict opponent action], [reasoning begin], [reasoning end], [my action]
- NEVER combine steps or skip tags
- If sending a message, keep it short and informative
- Action commands MUST match the allowed formats exactly

Example Output:
[opponent reasoning begin]
Bob is in the living room holding a container. Since the kitchen hasn't been explored yet, he's likely searching for objects to put in his container. Last he mentioned checking the sofa area.
[opponent reasoning end]
[predict opponent action] goexplore <Living Room> (5000)
[reasoning begin]
Bob is focused on living room exploration. I should check the kitchen where no one has looked. This reduces duplication and speeds up overall progress.
[reasoning end]
[my action] goexplore <Kitchen> (6000)

gen,"My friend $OPPO_NAME$ and I want to transport as many target objects as possible to the bed with the help of containers within 3000 steps. I can hold two things at a time, and they can be objects or containers. I can grasp containers and put objects into them to hold more objects at a time. Given our shared goal, dialogue history, my progress, and previous actions, please help me generate a short message to send to $OPPO_NAME$ to help us achieve the goal as soon as possible. Note that a container can contain three objects, and will be lost once transported to the bed. I can only put objects into the container I hold after grasping it. All objects are denoted as <name> (id), such as <table> (712). Actions take several steps to finish. It may be costly to go to another room or transport to the bed, use these actions sparingly.
